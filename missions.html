                                   <p align="justify">Etawah Mission, formerly known as the Agra Mission, is the north Indian missionary
outreach of the Archeparchy of Changanacherry. Founded in 1975 Etawah Mission was
a response to a long cherished desire of the Catholic Church in India expressed in the
CBCI meeting of Kolkata that dioceses and religious congregations from South which
are rich in vocations may be requested to take up mission territories in North where the
missions were facing a shortage of personnel. There was also the constant demand of
the Syro Malabar Church for their right to engage in mission work in North outside its
territorium proprium.</p>
                      <p align="justify">As an answer to these twin desires that Most Rev. Dr. Dominic Athaide, then
Archbishop of Agra offered the Archeparchy of Changanacherry, territories for mission
work. Mar Antony Padiyara, then Archbishop of Changanacherry himself a missionary
gladly accepted the invitation and sent his priests and religious to the area entrusted to
the Archeparchy. Etawah Mission is a unique missionary venture in the history of the
Missions in India. Perhaps this is the only case of missionary co operation between two
Archdioceses following two different liturgical traditions - Agra, the Latin tradition and
Changanacherry, the East Syrian tradition. </p>
                      <p align="justify">The areas entrusted to our care were very backward and criminal in nature. The pioneer
missionaries, in consultation with those having experience in the area, felt that education
will be a very effective means of evangelization. Consequently the educational apostolate
of the mission was developed. She runs formal and non formal educational institutions
in the districts entrusted to her care - Etawah, Mainpuri, Farrukhabad, Kannauj, Auraiya
and Firozabad. The social work organization Samaj Kalyan Samiti, of the mission Etawah
through various programmes, is actively involved in the social outreach programmes for
the benefit of the women, children, economically and socially weak villagers, etc., in
these districts. </p>
                      <p align="justify">The Mission is in the forefront of ecumenism as we have a very cordial relation with
the CNI Christian brethren already present in this area. We both share two churches, the
Christ Church Etawah and All Souls Memorial Church, Fatehgarh for worship witnessing
to the ecumenical outreach of the mission. Our Etawah and Fatehgarh schools use the
land taken on lease from the CNI diocese of Agra. Sadbhavana inter religious meetings
are conducted many times a year to share our mutual faiths.</p>
                      <p align="justify">The year 2017 witnessed a big development in the ecclesiastical milieu of the Church
in India. On 9 Oct 2017 Holy Father Pope Francis through “The Letter to the Bishops of
India” accorded all India Jurisdiction for the Syro Malabar Church fulfilling a long cherished
desire and demand of the community. According to the apostolic letter all Syro Malabar
faithful living outside the territories of the present dioceses will now come under the newly
formed eparchy of Shamsabad in Telangana. Consequently the Syro Malabar faithful of
Etawah mission also became part of the newly formed diocese.</p>
<p align="justify">As a result and in continuation of this new development “we have come to an
agreement that Etawah Mission will be granted administrative, Pastoral and missionary
autonomy she has hitherto enjoyed under the Archdiocese of Agra and that a written
agreement will be made between the eparchy of Shamsabad and the archeparchy of
Changanacherry in this regard in the form of a contract”. (Agreement with Shamsabad,
p.1). This contract was solemnly signed on 24 February 2018 at Changanacherry and Very
Rev. Dr. James Palackal was appointed Vicar General of Etawah Mission for Shamsabad
eparchy. This had a very positive outcome as the agreement stipulates in its clause 5
that “the above mentioned territories of Etawah Mission may be raised to the dignity of
an eparchy/exarchy in due course of time”.</p>

    <p align="justify">The Church of Christ by her very nature is missionary (AG 2). The Archeparchy of
Changanacherry has been very faithful to this divine call and the most recent chapter
in her missionary journey is the opening of the St. Mary's Syro Malabar Mission in the
state of Rajasthan in the wake of the All India Jurisdiction given to the Syro Malabar
Church by His Holiness Pope Francis. St. Mary's Syro Malabar Mission in Rajasthan is the
result of the missionary and pastoral collaboration between the newly erected eparchy of
Shamshabad, created for missionary work in the rest of India and for the care of migrant
Syro Malabarians, with the archeparchy of Changanacherry. It is to be specifically placed
on record that the new St. Mary's mission, comprising the 12 civil districts of Rajasthan
– Jaipur, Alwar, Bharatpur, Dausa, Dhaulpur, Karuli, Tonk, Sawai Madhopur, Bundi, Kota,
Baran and Jhalawar – is the fruit of the missionary zeal and genuine ecclesial vision of
Mar Joseph Perumthottam, Archbishop of Changanacherry Archeparchy. When the offer
for starting a Syro Malabar mission in the state of Rajasthan was placed by the eparchy
of Shamshabad, and even before that, it was whole heartedly accepted by Archbishop Joseph Perumthottam. St. Mary's mission in Rajasthan is the second missionary venture
of the archeparchy of Changanacherry in North India </p>
    <p align="justify">The official signing of the contract
between the archeparchy of Changanacherry and the eparchy of Shamshabad took place
on April 24, 2019, after long and due considerations in respective competent bodies, at
Mount St. Thomas, Kakkanadu. Mar Joseph Perumthottam of Changanacherry and Mar
Raphael Thattil of Shamshabad duly signed the contract for their respective Eparchies.
Very Rev. Dr. James Palackal of the Archeparchy of Changanacherry was appointed
Vicar General of the Etawah and Jaipur missions by His Excellency Mar Raphel Thattil
and the Mission Superior of Jaipur mission by His Grace Mar Joseph Perumthottam. </p>
    <p align="justify">Provision of All India Jurisdiction to the Syro Malabar Church, the establishment of
the eparchy of Shamshabad, meritorious leadership and ardent love of His Grace Mar
Joseph Perumthottam for the Syro Malabar migrants and the zealous contributions and
effective interventions of Mar Raphel Thattil paved the way for the beginning of the
St. Mary's mission, also known as Jaipur mission, in Rajasthan. Nonetheless, even before
the establishment of the eparchy of Shamshabad in 2018, at the repeated requests of
the migrant Syro Malabar faithful in Jaipur, Mar Joseph Perumthottam decided to send
a priest to look after the spiritual and pastoral needs of the migrant Syro Malabar faithful
in Jaipur. Accordingly, Rev. Fr. Sebastian Souriamakil came to Jaipur on June 2, 2015</p>
    <p align="justify">Fr. Sebastian was able to form a Syro Malabar community in the city of Jaipur with the
name Syro Malabar Holy Family Mission. Fr. Sebastian Souriamakil served the mission
for one year and seven months and left for Saudi Arabia for pastoral work. Then, Rev. Fr.
Melvin Pallikizhakethil from the Etawah mission served this mission from February 1, 2017
to November 13, 2017. Rev. Fr. Paul Peediyekkal was appointed priest in charge of the
Jaipur mission on November 13, 2017. After that, Fr. Varghese Punnakalayil, Fr. Joseph
Pulickaparampil, Fr. Philip Moozhikunnel and Fr. George Mannumadom were also appointed
in the mission. On 20 February 2022 Holy Family Syro Malabar Church was consecreted. </p>

  <h3>Missions</h3>
                <br>
                <h5>Virudhunagar (31 May, 2019)</h5><br>
                <p align="justify">     The territorial jurisdiction of the eparchy of Changanacherry got extended from the
                  Pampa River in the State of Kerala to the South upto Kanyakumari in the State of Tamil
                  Nadu on April 29, 1955 by Pope Pius XII with the papal Bull, Multorum Fidelium. With this
                  extension from 1960 onwards many young priests, religious and laity of the Archeparchy
                  Archeparchy of Changanacherry 401 DIRECTORY 2021-22
                  volunteered to devote themselves in the evangelization works in Kanyakumari Mission
                  sharing the Gospel among the local people and forming them in the liturgy and spirituality
                  of the Syro Malabar Church. This Mission made tremendous growth due to the apostolic
                  zeal and enthusiasm of its pioneer missionaries. As a result, on November 11, 1996
                  Archeparchy of Changanacherry was bifurcated establishing Eparchy of Thuckalay, by the
                  papal Bull Apud Indorum, which encompasses the whole of Kanyakumari Mission. Again,
                  on October 10, 2017 Pope Francis extended the territory of the Eparchy of Thuckalay
                  comprising 9 civil districts namely, Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Virudhunagar,
                  Theni, Thenkasi, Madurai, Sivagangai and Ramanathapuram (above 30000 sq/kms). After
                  having many Inter Eparchial meetings on mission itself, as per invitation from the Bishop
                  of Thuckalay, the Archeparchy of Changanacherry decided to undertake Virudhunagar
                  Mission and sent Rev. Fr. Peter Kizhakkeyil, a missionary priest of this Archeparchy, to
                  the new mission land. This new mission was inaugurated on May 30, 2019, on the Feast
                  of the Ascension of Jesus Christ. O. Kovilpatti and Inam Rettiapatti are the new mission
                  stations. Rev. Fr. Joseph Keeranchira was appointed in 2022. On 03 April 2022 St. Joseph
                  Syro Malabar Catholic Church was consecrated.
